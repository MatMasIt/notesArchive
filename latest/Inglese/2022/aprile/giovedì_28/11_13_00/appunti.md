Joyce
Direct interior monologue: free, direct, not mediated

two types of direct

* 2 levels; mix of external (external time) and internal narration (inner time)
* 1 level: only free internal flow, extreme experimentation

Woolf usuall: stream of conscience mediated by an external third person

reshaping of the classical tradition, myth in a modern context with a completely different meaning 

opposite meaning

Mythical method: recover the past in a completely different context and with a reversal of maening
