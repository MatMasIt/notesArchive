Sybil Vane gets tired of impersonating another character, that is not herself

she leaves the theater, her job


Dorian Gray leaves her

Sybil Vane kills herself

Dorian Gray is responsible for that

corrupt, depraved life

Dorian kills basil because he considers him responsible of dorian's spiritual corruption

he cannot bear this burden, seeing his corruption seen in the picture

he decides to get rid of the portrait

getting rid of the portait will free him, so he thinks


the portrait is a witness to his spiritual corruption


he stab the portrait but he dies while the portrait survives

his servants will not recognize him

old, ugly, wrinkled

the rings are the same 

the portrait returns to his original beauty


reversal of roles

dorian gray and portrait: double side of victorian age, victorian compromise



art survives people and is eternal
