Droain Gray thinks about his boyhood before he was famous

Hetti merton: innocent country girl

he wants to move to the countryside with a girl

Change or just another aesthete's experience

he had told her he was poor (the girl believed but it is false) and wicked (he is bad, honest)

The girl laughs because wicked people are old and ugly but doria gray is young and beautiful


innocence,purity, goodness, which dorian does not have

Dorian gray caused the disgrace to many
* basil (killed)
* Sybil Vane (suicide)

he is regretting his pact with the devil

he took a mirror and looked at himself

same as the "night on horror" when he saw the portrait change

He cannot bear his beauty anymore because it caused his corruption

James Vein wanted to kill Dorian Grey but died in an hunting party (battuta di caccia)

last years of James Vein's life were haunted by his sister's suicide
