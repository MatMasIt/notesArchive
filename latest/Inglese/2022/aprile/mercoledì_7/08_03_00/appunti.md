Hetti merton: innocent country girl

he wants to move to the countryside with a girl

Change or just another aesthete's experience

he had told her he was poor (the girl believed but it is false) and wicked (he is bad, honest)

The girl laughs because wicked people are old and ugly but doria gray is young and beautiful


innocence,purity, goodness, which dorian does not have

Dorian gray caused the disgrace to many
* basil (killed)
* Sybil Vane (suicide)
