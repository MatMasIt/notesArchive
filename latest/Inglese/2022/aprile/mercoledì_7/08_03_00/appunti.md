Droain Gray thinks about his boyhood before he was famous

happy merton: innocent girl

he wants to move to the countryside with a girl

he had told her he was poor (the girl believed but it is false) and wicked (he is bad, honest)

The girl laughs because wicked people are old and ugly but doria gray is young and beautiful
