Lord Henry's advice to Dorian gray:
> Live really, perfectly, and fully.
> * don't waste time following strict victorial moral code
> * try everything push yourself to the excess

When you grow old you become ugly, there are no triumphs left for you

You cannot be happy anymore

Fear of aging

stem = beauty, time is jealous of beauty and an enemy

You will become sallow (yellow skin), hollow cheecked (guance avvizite) and dull eyes(eyes that do not shine anymore)

Aging is like a panful disease, sickness

Don't listen the victorians

sick ideals, aims

strict ad false moralcode

the victorian age needs a change

doeian can become a symbol to this change


Hedonism: a life of pleasure

the world belongs to you for a season: youth

immortality of art


unti you are young you are not aware of the power of your beauty
