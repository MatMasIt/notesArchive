Lord Henry's advice to Dorian gray:
> Live really, perfectly, and fully.
> * don't waste time following strict victorial moral code
> * try everything push yourself to the excess

When you grow old you become ugly, there are no triumphs left for you

You cannot be happy anymore

Fear of aging

stem = beauty, time is jealous of beauty and an enemy

You will become sallow (yellow skin), hollow cheecked (guance avvizite) and dull eyes(eyes that do not shine anymore)

Aging is like a panful disease, sickness

Don't listen the victorians

sick ideals, aims

strict ad false moralcode

the victorian age needs a change

doeian can become a symbol to this change


Hedonism: a life of pleasure

the world belongs to you for a season: youth

immortality of art


unti you are young you are not aware of the power of your beauty


maggiociondolo: laburnum   =   yellow trees


process of death and rebirth for plants but noth for dorian

clematis; rammpicante (climbing plant)

greeen leaves with purple stars (flowers)

> **Youth! Youth! There is absolutely , nothing in the world but youth!’***
à



old: not human beings anymore, just hideous puppets

regrets for not having the courage to indulge in temptations

How Dorian Gray reacts


For the first time dorian gray experiences his own beauty

Before the realization of his handsomeness he thought they were obly friendly compliments


the panegiric  worried him

as he is looking at the 

shadow of his own loveliness = portrait

sudden revelation

effects of aging


he will become terrible and clumsy

second effect: sharp pain
