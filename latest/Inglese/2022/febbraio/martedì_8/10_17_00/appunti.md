Oliver Twist

Children are supposed to thank God for the meal

Sarcasm, nothing to be grateful for 

It seems like a religious ceremony


Parody of the parrochial world

supposed to be philantrhopic but it is not


Oliver committed a crime by asking for food


Solemn conclave, like religous summit

contrast fat man and children

twofold image of the children

They are victims at the start

according to the runners of the workhouse they are criminals after Oliver asks for more


culprit: il colpevole


guilty of: colpevole di 

Children from victim to culprits as the point of view changes



The Board, the officials

Robert Louis Stevenson

_The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide (1886)_


This novel represents different types of novels

Psychological novel, theme of the double, duality of man


Detective story/ Crime novel

Msteryies to solve

Gripping to read, suspensful


Truth revealed only in the last chapter


Perfectly represents the hypocrisy of the victorian Age, expecially in London
