quarter of london in contrast with the previous one

air of invitation vs negligence and squallor of the opposite quarter

one good side and one bad side of the  building

Homless people gathered near the door


poor district

nobody cares about the door

dark side of London and dark side of Dr. Jekyll

door used by Mr. hide


Late at night, winter

misterious, gloomy, dark settings

The little man steps over te little girl


mr hide is so disgusting that mr enfild sweats

cold and unemotional doctor
