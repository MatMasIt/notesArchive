Jekyll's experiment

Suicide letter left in hos studio

he explains everything


at first he did not know duality of man and only followed the moral side

He wanted to be either good or bad

separate identities

but he was radically both

scientific experiments as a kind of miracle


they go beyond the limits of the human nature

miracle, daydream

if each of his sides of personality could be separated in two different identities life could be  more bearable 

side inclined to transgression
