Jekyll's experiment

Suicide letter left in hos studio

he explains everything


at first he did not know duality of man and only followed the moral side

He wanted to be either good or bad

separate identities

but he was radically both

scientific experiments as a kind of miracle


they go beyond the limits of the human nature

miracle, daydream

if each of his sides of personality could be separated in two different identities life could be  more bearable 

side inclined to transgression

upright twin


the unjust might go his way without the sense of regret

opposite twins

identical but different

polar twins linked together 


how were dissociated: experiment explained

he wants to be free to express his immoral tendencies without feeling regretful and keeping his reputation


He makes a potion
First reaction is bad: most terrible pains in the bones
nauesea
horror of the spirit


after a while he recovers as if out of a great sickness, illness


He feels lighter and better
