Utterson: cold, scnty, introverted, backward, reticent

Austere with himself, tolerante towards the others

he wants to display his respectable side


he is envious of the emotions that people who make misdeeds experience


double nature of mr utterson

hypocritical man

Friends relatives

its not the quality, but the passing of time


people could not understand what was in common between utterson and mr anfield


they had nothing in common, looked dull and bored on sunday excursions

had nothing to say to each other

looked releived when a friend joined

but actually, they saw sunday as the jewel of the week, they liked the excursion very much, despite their interests diverged

they are symbols of the acceptance of double nature of humans
