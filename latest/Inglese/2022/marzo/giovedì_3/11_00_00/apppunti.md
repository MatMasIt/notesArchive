its not the quality, but the passing of time


people could not understand what was in common between utterson and mr anfield


they had nothing in common, looked dull and bored on sunday excursions

had nothing to say to each other

looked releived when a friend joined

but actually, they saw sunday as the jewel of the we

they are symbols of the acceptance of double nature of humans
