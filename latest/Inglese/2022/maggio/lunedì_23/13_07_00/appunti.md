TS elliot

sterility of modernism vs fetile past

men are alienated, spiritually dead, cannot live again

for Chaucer april was a sweet month




In elliot just another circle of despair starts


objective correlative


the emotion istelf is not mentioned, but evoked through a series of images, situations etc


carelessness, untidy flat

sexual relationship with ugly boy: squallor


objective correlatives

eating always the same things

dull, monotonous life

spiritually dead people

lack of passion

sad and bored, time to have love

objective correlative, lack of passio and emotions

boredom, no excitement, passion

mechanical love, phisical love

boy just cares about fullfilment of phisical desire

fragmented, references to dante, chaucher, shakespeare, the bible, etc

but with new characters, the typist, the boy


mythical method and objective correlative
