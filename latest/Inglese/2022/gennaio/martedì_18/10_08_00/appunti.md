### es 6
1. 18 different churches
l. 22, 38-39
Labouring people did not attend churches

They did nothing but watched the church-goers
middle class criticism against the working classes
accused of being lazy
Church bells did not call the working class away from their own houses
They just walked around in laziness and watched the people going to church

2. the other residents of coketown wanted to change their behaivour by force (l 47) petitioning for act of parliament

Middle classes thought people could be controlled by parliament


Workers considered as an inferior race

4. They showed that the workers used to get drunk

5. Druggist and chemists are opium addicted

The chaplain of the jail said they used to sing and danced in obscene ways


All together they were "bad lot" (bad people)

Middle class
They were never thankful
always restless
never satisfied

but actually they were satisfied with the few things that they ahd

They did not drink moka coffee ( coffeee with milk  and chocolate )
(only tea or black cofee)

prime meat parts (but they ate rice, bread etc)

so the author says ironically the opposite to denounce the working class starvation
