# The Wall - Pink Floyd

1. What element of the video (character/ scene/ image) struck you the most?
The most striking image is the meatgrinder of kids, symbolic of the dehumanization and uniformation of school, a message that the song wants to convey
2. Can you find any analogies between the video of the song and the text “Mr. Gradgrind” (from “Hard Times”)?
Indeed, the teacher in the song represses a kid's creativity and is focused on teaching "hard facts" to the students, completely disreagarding their humanity
3. What’s the meaning of the “wall” in your opinion?
The wall is the colelction of all kids, which are to the school system undistringuishable and dull bricks that form it

Teacher so frustrated by strict iews that he reverses on the boys his home sufferance and frustration

His wife commanding him like he does in class

All the desks are the same, they walk with a mask

No in
