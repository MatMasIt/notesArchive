Put together supernatural and realistic elements
Making extraordinary things ordinary

## p.289 The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

2 main characters, the ancient mariner and the wedding guest

Killing of the albatros is irrational and punished

The mariner considers slimy creatures inferior, ugly

He is guilty again


Mariner does not die but he remains alone on the ship, so he is alone

Reconciliation of the Mariner with the creatures

Dead mariners, celestial spirits rise again, resuscitate

Just spirits, just souls

Mariner is not alone anymore


The wedding guest will learn something (moral teaching) from the mariner

In the end he is wiser and happier

He has to go to the wedding though

He learned _respect for nature_


Why does the mariner stop the wedding guest?

It is part of the punishment:

He is ==doomed== to wander alone **forever**, until ==the end of his days== telling his story to the people that he meets

He cannot rest

And outcast but with a curse
