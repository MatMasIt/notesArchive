Tempest compared to animal roaring

They escaped towards the south


Iceberg floating on the water

sublime landscape 
Mixture of natural and unnatural

green ice: misterious but attractive

There was nothing but ice

No creature can live there


Scary sounds


Albratros: sign of good luck

Albatros: like a cross, symbol of goss which comes to save the mariners


Albatros ahs the power to split the eyes

ship can move again


both a real and a supernatural creature


It perched (stood on a perch, trespolo)

They are leaving, the weather is getting better


Through the fog they can perceive the glimmering of the moonshine

The ancient marine kills the bird



Phantom ship
