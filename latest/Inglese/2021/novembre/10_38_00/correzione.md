8. Wordsworth's vision of poetry is evident in the poem "Daffodils" in which he describers a sensory experience (namely he sees a "group" of dafforild besides a lake, beneath a tree, which are compared to stars in order to convery Wordsworth's idea of a pantheistic nature), thanks to which he experiences certain emotions (he is happy but he does not understand the bliss he has just received); afterwards, he recollects them in tranquility (once he is at home and alone he is able to recollect the sensations of that day), he contemplates then, thanks to the gift of imagination, leadig to the creation of newer and even stroinger feelings ( an ability which is exclusive to poets), and uses such feelings to create poetry. The inward eye is also referenced in the poem as a metaphor of imagination, thus adding another link between "Daffodils and "The Preface"
