> Q: _How is the theory of the complementary opposites shown in the two poems?_
> (phisical appeareance, characteristics, settings)
> ==write a short passage==
> A: _The two poems can be compared in a number of aspects: the tiger represents adulthood, which is not as pure and as uncorrupt as childhood (of which the lamb is an allegory), however both states have to coexist at the same time to have a full appriciation of the human experience. 
> The poet during childhood can understand and see things that he cannot during adulthood, and becomes more daring._


Tiger: malevolent side of nature
Lamb: benevolent side of nature
