Robert Walton is the mirro image of doc. Frankestein because they are both overrreachers, and can be both associated to the myth of prometeus

nobody had reached yet the north pole

> "Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous it the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier is the man who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow" 
> _(Viktor Frankestein to capt Robert Walton)_

Meaning: ignorance carries more happiness than the endless and infinite pursuit of knowledge


Warning to Walton, so that he learns from his errors

Frankestein realizes his pursuit was wrong and it lead to a tragedy
