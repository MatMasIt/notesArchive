> "Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous it the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier is the man who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow" 
> _(Viktor Frankestein to capt Robert Walton)_

Meaning: ignorance carries more happiness than the endless and infinite pursuit of knowledge
