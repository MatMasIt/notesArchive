Gulliver's travels texts

T38, p 226

Gulliver is speaking, first person narrator

Precise description of the content of the pockets

Handkerchief

foot-cloth: carpet (l.12)   distortion

---


they find a Huge silver chest that they were not able to lift

When somebody steps in the chest, he finds himself in a kind of dust, which makes them sneeze when it flies to their faces

It could be gunpowder, but it's not, it's **tobacco**

Lilliputians don't know tobacco

---

bundle of white thin substances folded onw over another, about the bigness of three man, tie with a strong cable and marked with black figures (cifre), which we humbly conceive to be writing

Every letter is half as large as the palm of our hands


Letters that he wrote to his family, and other documents

---

In the left pocket, engine
20 long poles
resembling the fence before the Majesty's court

They conjecture it is a comb

They don't know, they think it is a machine


---
Two fobs, where he used to keep the clocks

Silver chain with a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom

It looks like a glob, circular

half silver, half of a transparent metal (glass)

Strange figures circularly drawn

It's a clock

Lucid subtance (glass) stops them from touching the figures

Distorted description


He puts the engine to their ears, incessant noise, like that of a whatermill


They conjecture it is either an unknown animal or the God that he worsips

They suppose it is a God that he worhips, because he always consult that object before doing aything, an oracle

---


Very detailed, precise, realistic description of the objects

Absurd and funny because the reader is amused because of the distortion of familiar objects


Different perspectives, typical of the traveller


> *coarse cloth* $\implies$ stoffa grezza

## p.227 es 2.3
|Lilliputian's perspective|Real Object|
|----|----|
|large coarse cloth|handkerchief|
|huge silver chest containing unknown irritant dust|tobacco box (it was calld a *snuff box*)|
|white substance with writing|letters, documents|
|engine with poles|comb|
|God or animal|clock|

Lilliputians are very precise and rational

Admiration

* l.11 stricted search
* l.23, 24 conjecture:
 try to find a solution in a rational way

Search very deailed and strict but useles
