Robinson Crusoe, p 214
Reading the bible and praying every day, three times a day
He has to go hunting, cooking for the day
In the evining he works on his "empire"
In the final passage (l 5-58)
He is describing how he managed to build a board for a long shelf
Hard labor and work caused by three lackings:
* Tools
* Help
* Skills
so it takes so much time (40 days to build a shelf)
With the specific tools sawyers would have cut 6 boards like that in half a day
It took three days to cut down the tree, two more days to cut up the branches 
he reduced it into chips to make it light enough to move
he made both sides smooth and the shelf was 3 inches thick
**labour and patience** : Robinson's qualities


*viz*, means "*that is to say*"


Patience and hard work:
* puritan belief, salvaion derives from hard work and prayer
* middle class man's attitude to achieve the middle state
Buildining the **Empire**, perfect embodient of the middle state thaat he is trying to escape
*Contradictory* character, he rebuilds the english society (material, happiness, indicidualism, productivness)
* Rational, practical attitude of the **augustan age**
His meter of judgment is the utility of things

Robinson considers nature only as a way to satisfy his material needs
*It is a commody to exploit to satisfy material needs*

Friday is beautiful *because* he seems european

Robinson is racist, prejudiced

Europeans felt superior, had the right to enslave the natives

The theme of  the **otherness**

Perspective, perception

It's just a matter of a point of view, 

Everyone seems *other* to anyone

Friday wants to thank Robinson

sows signs of humblness, submissions

In his opinion this behaivour is  simething natural and compulsory

Typical ENGLISH COLONIZER, natives are inferior

MASTER-SLAVE relationship

he tries to teach Friday english

 he teaches him yes/no (orders from the colonizer)

He also teaches him "Master", that was to be Robinson's name

Line 34 

Robinson does not allow Friday to maintain his habits

He was completely nude, but Robinson does not allow this

Friday himself he is a cannibal, he sows to Robinson that he would like to dig bodies up and eat them (l.38,39)

Robinson was horrored, disgusted

so he ordered to him to come away and friday obeys
