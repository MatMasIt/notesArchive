Robinson Crusoe, p 214
Reading the bible and praying every day, three times a day
He has to go hunting, cooking for the day
In the evining he works on his "empire"
In the final passage (l 5-58)
He is describing how he managed to build a board for a long shelf
Hard labor and work caused by three lackings:
* Tools
* Help
* Skills
so it takes so much time (40 days to build a shelf)
With the specific tools sawyers would have cut 6 boards like that in half a day
It took three days to cut down the tree, two more days to cut up the branches 
he reduced it into chips to make it light enough to move
he made both sides smooth and the shelf was 3 inches thick
**labour and patience** : Robinson's qualities


*viz*, means "*that is to say*"


Patience and hard work:
* puritan belief, salvaion derives from hard work and prayer
* middle class man's attitude to achieve the middle state
Buildining the **Empire**, perfect embodient of the middle state thaat he is trying to escape
*Contradictory* character, he rebuilds the english society (material, happiness, indicidualism, productivness)
* Rational, practical attitude of the **augustan age**
His meter of judgment is the utility of things

Robinson considers nature only as a way to satisfy his material needs
*It is a commody to exploit to satisfy material needs*
