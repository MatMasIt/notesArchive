Friday is beautiful *because* he seems european

Robinson is racist, prejudiced

Europeans felt superior, had the right to enslave the natives

The theme of  the **otherness**

Perspective, perception

It's just a matter of a point of view, 

Everyone seems *other* to anyone

Friday wants to thank Robinson

sowns signs of humblness, submissions
