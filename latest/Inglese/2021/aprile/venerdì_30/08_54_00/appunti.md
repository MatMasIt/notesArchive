Friday is beautiful *because* he seems european

Robinson is racist, prejudiced

Europeans felt superior, had the right to enslave the natives

The theme of  the **otherness**

Perspective, perception

It's just a matter of a point of view, 

Everyone seems *other* to anyone

Friday wants to thank Robinson

sows signs of humblness, submissions

In his opinion this behaivour is  simething natural and compulsory

Typical ENGLISH COLONIZER, natives are inferior

MASTER-SLAVE relationship

he tries to teach Friday english

 he teaches him yes/no (orders from the colonizer)

He also teaches him "Master", that was to be Robinson's name

Line 34 

Robinson does not allow Friday to maintain his habits

He was completely nude, but Robinson does not allow this
