p.286 Daffodils

$v.4$ golden: sight

Startig point of romantic poetr: sensory experience

Both daffodils and stars shine and wiknle
In fact daffodils are golden 


Comparing daffodils to the sky: Wordsworth's belief that they are linked together in the same great universal order

endless, infinite, shining: similatiries

waves of the lake

Sight of the daffodils made the poet much more happy than the dancing waves of the lake

A poet could not but be gay (happy)
He refers to himself as happy


Glee, gay, jocund

He gazed and gazed


He did not think so much at that moment to the pleasure that that view was bringing him 


Inner eye: blessing of soliture


Daffodils flash on the inwasrd eye (gift of the poet)


Interior eye allows the poet to see beyond what people do and to recover previous emotions

Emotion he can recall is even stringer than the original one

he can feel and create while he is
