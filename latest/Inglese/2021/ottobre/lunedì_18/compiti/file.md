8. Wordsworth vision of poetry is evident because he has a sensory experience, emotions, recollects them in tranquility, contemplates, has newer and even stronger feeling, makes poetry

9. I was once at the top of a cliff during a mountain vacation and I had a spectacular view of a valley.
 There were some people nearby talking and the voices were echoing in the barren landscape yet a bit further you could see a forest with trees and a field.
I was unsettled by the height of the rock I was standing on and the distance I could peer, the contrast of the landscape, too.
That moment stayed in my mind.
