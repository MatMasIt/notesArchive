8. Wordsworth vision of poetry is evident because he has a sensory experience (namely he sees a group of daffodils besides a lake, beneath a tree) emotions, recollects them in tranquility, contemplates, has newer and even stronger feeling, makes poetry.
The inward eye is also referenced in the poem, thus adding anohter link between the two texts.

10. I was once at the top of a cliff during a mountain vacation and I had a spectacular view of a valley.
 There were some people nearby talking and the voices were echoing in the barren landscape yet a bit further you could see a forest with trees and a field.
I was unsettled by the height of the rock I was standing on and the distance I could peer, the contrast of the landscape, too.
That moment stayed in my mind.
