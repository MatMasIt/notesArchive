8. Wordsworth's vision of poetry is evident in the poem "Daffodils" because he has a sensory experience (namely he sees a group of daffodils besides a lake, beneath a tree, which are compared to stars in order to convey Wordsworth's idea of a pantheistic nature), then he experiences emotions (he is happy but does not understand the bliss he just received); afterwards, he recollects them in tranquility (once he is at home and alone he is able to recollect the sensations of that day), he contemplates, having newer and even stronger feelings (an ability which is exclusive to poets),  and uses such feelings to create  poetry.
The inward eye is also referenced in the poem, thus adding another link between the two texts.
10. During a mountain trip which took place some years ago I  found myself at the top of a cliff and I had a spectacular view of a valley.
 There were some people talking nearby and you could distinctly hear them chatting and laughing, however I could not make out what they were saying.
Before my eyes lied a barren landscape yet a bit further you could see a forest with trees and a field and some buildings further on the line of the horizon, which was blurred by mist and fog.
I was unsettled by the height of the rock I was standing on and the distance I could peer, the contrast of the landscape, too, gave me a peculiar sensation,
I tried to speak and I heard my voice not echoed back, but rather muted and low in comparison to what I expected.
That moment stayed in my mind.
