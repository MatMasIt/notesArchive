### The country of the blind:
Teh protagonist finds a village of people who lived in a place from 10 to 15 generations

all  of them are blind

They don't understand, they think he is crazy

the only way to be accepted is to become blind, but he goes away

He accepts to be different in the end

### Bliss:
Katherine Mansfield, masters a narrative technique
*Interior monologue/Stream of consciousness*: free flow of thougths, feelings, emotions, sensations in the mind of the character (theorized by James)

> The verbal expression of a *stream of consciousness* is an *interior monologue*

metaphor of swallowing the sun



Modernist Authors (20th century)

Virginia Woolf (Mrs. Dallaway, book)
James Joyce (Dubliners, collection of 15 short stories) (Ulisses, book, whole novel is an interior monologue, most experimental, some parts have **no** punctuation)


In "Bliss" there is not a particular plot, set during a dinner

> Mrs. dallaway: buying flower for an important dinner


Focus on the emotions, the mind, not the events 

symbolism is in commn too
