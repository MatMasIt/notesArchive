## “THE STRANGE CASE OF DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE”  (1886 - novel) – p.110 vol. 2

“It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both”

  

“If each, I told myself, could but be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of his extraneous evil”

  

“It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together – that in the agonised womb of consciousness these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then, were they dissociated?”

  

“And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself, it seemed natural and human.”

  

“I have observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone, in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil”

  

“I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted”

  

(p. 115-116 “Jekyll’s experiment”)

## “THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY” (1891 – Oscar Wilde – Aesthetic Movement) p. 126 vol. 2

“Then he loathed his own beauty, and, flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery”

  

“It was the portrait that had done everything”

  

“Perhaps of his life became pure, he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face. […] yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him. […] He went in quietly [..] and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and indignation broke from him. He could see no change save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning, and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome – more loathsome, if possible, than before – and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilt. Then he trembled. […] There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing had dripped – blood even on the hand that had not held the knife”

  

“It was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul he was looking at.”

  

“The picture itself – that was evidence. He would destroy it. […] It had been like conscience to him. He would destroy it. […] It would kill this monstrous soul-life, and, without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace”.

(p. 132-133 vol 2)
