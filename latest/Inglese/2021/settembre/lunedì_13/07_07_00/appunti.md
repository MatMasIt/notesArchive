## Remembering a short story, The signalman, notes

The signalman is a story about a signalman who works at a railway intersection

The narrator dicusses the duties of the work with him and he explains that he sees a ghost sometimes saying "Halloa below there"

The duties require precision but not a great  deal of work

the same way the narrator called him is the way the ghost called him and the train conductor will call him
