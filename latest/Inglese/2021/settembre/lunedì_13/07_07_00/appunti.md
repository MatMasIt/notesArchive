## Remembering a short story, The signalman, notes


three days,
approach, discuss, death

The signalman is a story about a signalman who works at a railway intersection

The narrator dicusses the duties of the work with him and he explains that he sees a ghost sometimes saying "Halloa below there"

The duties require precision but not a great  deal of work

the same way the narrator called him is the way the ghost called him and the train conductor will call him "below there"

He had seen the ghost before and accidents occurred

"clear the way" ghost and train conductor

The image of the hand on the eye, same as conductor

the signalman stayed on the rails
