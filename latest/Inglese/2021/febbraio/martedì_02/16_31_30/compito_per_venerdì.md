# About Cowardice

## p. 140 e.8 literature book

The textbook definition of *"cowardice"* would be *"the behaviour of someone who is not at all brave and tries to avoid danger"*, and I think that is a correct definition, however we must ponder on what qualifies as "cowardice" and when it is acceptable.

I don't agree with those who consider cowardice an evil aptitude, on the contrary, fear has been a driving force for all human history, for better or for worse, and still is an important part of everyone's experience.

On the other end, giving in to fear too many times leads people away from taking many important steps and chances in their life, and may keep people from helping others when they need it.

In the end I think we should critically think about our actions and not be exclusively lead by fear.
