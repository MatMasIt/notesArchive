# notesArchive

## An archive of all my school notes

### View my notes at my [Notes Browser](https://matmasit.github.io/notesArchive/) !

My home server keeps a copy of these notes, too.

The notes are mostly in Italian (I am italian and attending an Italian school)

As of 27/04/2021, also the notes actually taken at school are here (thanks to Stackedit and my tablet).

A custom notes browser elegantly allows notes browsing (recents and per fodler)

The notes browser is implemented through a periodic github action which updates a json ["tree of resources"](https://github.com/MatMasIt/notesArchive/blob/main/viewer/list.json).
