# notesArchive

## An archive of all my school notes

### View my notes at the [Notes Browser](https://matmasit.github.io/notesArchive/) !

This repository is linked with my home server and my school notes are regularly uploaded here (every 6 hours or so)

The notes are mostly in Italian (I am italian and attending an Italian school)

As of 27/04/2021, also the notes actually taken at school are here (thanks to Stackedit and my tablet)

A custom notes browser elegantly allows notes browsing
